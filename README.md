# Data-Analysis-Project-Classification-and-Regression
Data Analytics Project using R: Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Multiple Linear Regression. Includes data exploration, model building, and performance evaluation.

# Data Analysis Project: Classification and Regression

This repository contains three analyses conducted on two datasets as part of a data analytics assignment using R. The analyses include:
1. **Decision Trees** (Classification)
2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** (Classification)
3. **Multiple Linear Regression** (Regression)

The project also includes a detailed report generated using **R Markdown** that describes the data exploration process, model building, and performance evaluation.

## üîç Dataset
The datasets used for this analysis are stored in the `datasets/` folder. This data was explored and cleaned before performing the analyses. The first is an obesity dataset (used for kNN and decision trees) and the other is a bike rental dataset (for regression).

## üìù Project Structure

- **datasets/**: Contains the dataset used for the analyses.
- **decision-tree/**: Includes the R script for building and evaluating the Decision Tree classification model.
- **knn/**: Contains the R script for implementing k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification.
- **regression/**: Contains the R script for building and evaluating the Multiple Linear Regression model.
- **report/**: Contains the R Markdown file (`.Rmd`) used to generate the analysis report, along with the rendered HTML version.

## üìù Analysis and Reports

### 1. **Decision Trees (Classification)**
- **R Markdown File**: [Decision_Tree_Erin_Kennedy.rmd](decision-tree/Decision_Tree_Erin_Kennedy.rmd)
- **HTML Report**: [Decision_Tree_Erin_Kennedy.html](decision-tree/Decision_Tree_Erin_Kennedy.html)
- **Description**: This analysis uses Decision Trees for classification purposes. The R Markdown file includes detailed explanations, and the HTML report presents the results.

### 2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) (Classification)**
- **R Markdown File**: [KNN_Erin_Kennedy.rmd](knn/KNN_Erin_Kennedy.rmd)
- **HTML Report**: [KNN_Erin_Kennedy.html](knn/KNN_Erin_Kennedy.html)
- **Description**: This analysis employs k-Nearest Neighbours for classification. The R Markdown file includes the methodology, and the HTML report shows the results and evaluation.

### 3. **Multiple Linear Regression (Regression)**
- **R Markdown File**: [Regression_Erin_Kennedy.rmd](regression/Regression_Erin_Kennedy.rmd)
- **HTML Report**: [Regression_Erin_Kennedy.html](regression/Regression_Erin_Kennedy.html)
- **Description**: This analysis performs Multiple Linear Regression to predict a target variable. The R Markdown file provides detailed insights, and the HTML report presents the final results and performance evaluation.


## üìë Report
The full analysis and findings are documented in the report located in the `report/` folder. It contains:
- A detailed description of the dataset with exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model building, tuning, and evaluation for each technique
- Performance metrics and plots for each model
- Discussion and reflections on the analyses, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
- **R Programming**: For data cleaning, model building, and analysis.
- **R Libraries**: `caret`, `rpart`, `ggplot2`, `class`.
- **R Markdown**: For generating the report.
